# No Self Pings

Some people really like that WordPress sends pings from your own site to your own site when you write posts; it gives them a trail of related posts.

Some people do not like this behavior; it clutters up their comments.

This plugin disables intra-blog pinging.

The technical stuff...

* Designed for both single and multi-site installations
* PHP7 compatible
* Passes [WordPress.com VIP](https://vip.wordpress.com) coding standards and fully compatible with their platform
* Fully internationalized, ready for translations. **If you would like to add a translation to this plugin then please head to the [Translating WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/no-self-ping "Translating WordPress") page**
* WCAG 2.0 Compliant at AA level
* Gutenberg ready

Once activated, there's nothing for you to do. However, head to Settings -> Discussion and you'll find a field in which you can, if you wish, specify more domains that won't be pinged. Why? Well, maybe you often refer to other sites that you maintain or, particularly, you run a multi-site and don't want each blog pinging the other - specify a list here and you're sorted.
